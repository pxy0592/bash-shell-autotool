In order to better understand what you can and can't do outside of @test blocks and setup or 
teardown functions, it's important to know how Bats processes test files. Below is a 
walkthrough by Sam:

1. First, each test file is preprocessed. This essentially amounts to replacing lines like @test
   "first test" { with test_first_test() { bats_begin_test "first test";, i.e. 
   turning each @test block into a test function.

2. Then, each test file is executed n+1 times, where n is the number of test cases in the file.

The first run evaluates the file without running any test functions, counting all the test cases in the 
file. If you invoke bats with -c, execution ends here; otherwise, the first run prints out the TAP 
header (1..n), then iterates over the test cases and executes each one in a new child process.

Each individual run again evaluates the entire test file, then invokes the setup function, if defined,
then invokes the specified test function, and finally invokes teardown. An exit trap is responsible 
for printing the TAP status (1 ok first test, 2 not ok second test).

If you call exit during the first run, the first run will not have a chance to invoke any test cases. 
That's a good way to fail fast if a dependency is missing. If you want to display an error message,
though, you must take care to preserve the TAP stream written to stdout, since the runner may 
depend on it.

Anything written to stdout or stderr in setup, teardown, or a test function is captured 
by Bats. If the test case fails, the error trap prints the output to the TAP stream as a comment.
Outside a test case, though, stdout is the TAP stream, so you'll want to specifically redirect any
output to stderr.
